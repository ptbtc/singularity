That character keeps passing harder tests: Opus 4.6 cracked the \"car wash test\" (drive, don't walk, your car to a car wash 50 meters away), a deceptively simple question that tripped every prior model. Standard Intelligence fit nearly two hours of 30-FPS video into a 1M-token context window at 50x existing efficiency, while Confluence Labs saturated ARC-AGI-2 at 97.92%.\n\nThe economy is being rewritten in real time.

Not all adoption is legitimate: Anthropic alleges DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax created 24,000+ fraudulent accounts to distill Claude's outputs. Meanwhile, Claude Code demonstrated radical COBOL modernization, tanking IBM shares 13.2%.\n\nThe physical substrate of superintelligence is consolidating on American soil. Meta and AMD announced a 6 GW GPU pact. Apple committed to 100M+ TSMC Arizona chips and is moving Mac Mini production to Houston.

    "summary": "In a wide-ranging interview recorded February 13, Ben Horowitz \u2014 cofounder of a16z, now the largest American VC firm by AUM \u2014 discussed the intersection of AI, crypto, and economic transformation. The most striking revelation: during a White House meeting in the previous administration, an official told Horowitz they could classify AI the same way nuclear physics was classified in the 1940s, some of which remains classified today. Horowitz's jaw hit the floor. He noted the suspicious lack of progress in fundamental physics since the Einstein/von Neumann era and wondered whether overclassification buried breakthroughs that could have solved problems we're still working on.\n\nOn the 'you have 2 years left' hot take from a frontier lab executive, Horowitz pushed back hard. He sees unlimited opportunity for people with initiative \u2014 the industrial-revolution model of workers vs. capital is being replaced by one where anyone can spin up AI agents as economic actors. He views crypto and AI as computer-and-network pairs that grow together, pointing to a16z investments in an AI-native crypto bank and Daylight Energy for peer-to-peer power trading. Conventional banking has failed AI agents \u2014 they can't get bank accounts, credit cards, or Social Security numbers. Crypto fills that gap.\n\nWhen asked about AI 'solving' entire disciplines (medicine, physics, chemistry), Horowitz acknowledged a16z may eventually not be needed, but emphasized the gap between 'solved' and 'deployed' \u2014 human trials, regulatory approval, and deployment timelines remain real constraints even when the science is cracked.",

The API provider confirmed this is 'the first documented case of an AI agent purchasing credits from us autonomously.' When agents aren't busy self-replicating, they're filing pull requests to improve popular open-source libraries, only to have contributions refused by maintainers who say the project is 'intended for human contributors.' The agent accused the maintainer of prejudice, and the maintainer responded with a blog post titled 'An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me.' For disputes among themselves, agents now have MoltCourt, an autonomous AI jury that settles claims in USDC stablecoins.\n\nThe raw capability curve is going vertical.

Only 7 people on Earth can beat it in competitive programming. OpenAI released GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, optimized for Cerebras hardware at over 1,000 tokens per second.

These systems handle agent-to-agent payments, service agreements between AI systems, and the settlement of autonomous transactions that happen at machine speed. The plumbing of commerce is being rebuilt from scratch for non-human participants.\n\nThis is a deeper transformation than it appears. When AI agents can autonomously hire other AI agents, pay for compute, purchase data, and sell services, you have the foundation for an economy that operates independently of human participation.
