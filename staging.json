    "full_text": "The Singularity is learning what it\u2019s made of. Anthropic now believes LLMs simulate diverse characters during pre-training, with post-training eliciting a specific \u201cAssistant\u201d persona via what it calls the Persona Selection Model , meaning your AI is best understood as a character that learned to play itself. That character just got smarter. Opus 4.6 has passed the \u201ccar wash test,\u201d correctly reasoning you should drive, not walk, your car to a car wash 50 meters away, a deceptively simple question that tripped up every prior Anthropic model. The perceptual bandwidth is scaling to match. Standard Intelligence achieved a breakthrough video encoder fitting nearly two hours of 30-FPS video into a 1M-token context window, roughly 50x more efficient than existing SOTA, while Confluence Labs saturated ARC-AGI-2 at 97.92% using LLM-driven program synthesis at just $11.77 per task. The new minds are reshaping the economy they inhabit. GitHub reports TypeScript has surpassed both Python and JavaScript as its most-used language for the first time, as AI code generation rewires developer preferences through convenience loops. A developer wanting FreeBSD WiFi on his old MacBook Pro simply asked Claude Code and Pi to write the driver , an early sign of how AI will liquefy the operating system. Not everyone is building cleanly. Anthropic alleges three Chinese AI companies, DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax, created over 24,000 fraudulent accounts , prompting Claude more than 16 million times to distill its outputs into their own products. The legitimate side of AI adoption is scaling just as fast. OpenAI announced \u201cFrontier Alliances\u201d with BCG, McKinsey, Accenture, and Capgemini to deploy AI coworkers at scale. The oldest code in the enterprise is the first to fall. Anthropic showed Claude Code radically streamlining COBOL modernization , and the market reacted instantly: IBM shares tanked 13.2% , the latest blue chip to be repriced by the intelligence explosion. The classified frontier is widening too. xAI signed a deal to let the military use Grok in battlefield systems where Claude was previously the only option. Thanks for reading The Innermost Loop!

Meta and AMD announced a long-term pact to power Meta\u2019s AI with up to 6 GW of AMD Instinct GPUs, aligning roadmaps across hardware, software, and systems. Apple committed to buying 100M+ chips from TSMC Arizona and is moving Mac Mini production to Houston , bringing the favorite OpenClaw agent host home from Asia. Upstream, ASML boosted EUV light source power to 1,000 watts from 600 , enabling up to 50% more chip output by 2030. The quantum advantage, long theoretical, is becoming operational. Quantinuum and QuSoft developed an algorithm solving complement sampling dramatically faster than any classical approach. The biological chassis is finally getting the maintenance schedule it deserves. Japan approved first-of-their-kind regenerative stem cell therapies for Parkinson\u2019s disease and severe heart failure. Diagnostics are sharpening just as fast as the cures. Spanish researchers found p-tau217 blood tests boost Alzheimer\u2019s diagnostic accuracy from 75.5% to 94.5%. It turns out the people around you are a biomarker too: epigenetic clock research shows each additional \u201chassler\u201d in your life adds roughly 9 months of biological age and 1.5% faster aging. The energy transition is outrunning the forecasters who track it. US battery storage hit a record 57.6 GWh in 2025 , up 4x in three years, with Texas about to overtake California. Meanwhile, lasers keep getting 2x cheaper every 4 years and 2x more powerful every 5 , a curve that suggests they may eventually replace all cartridge-based ammunition. The physical world is catching up to the digital one: in New York, Reflex Robotics humanoids are shoveling snow after Winter Storm Hernando, doing the work that no battery or laser can. The veil is lifting. The ODNI says UAP and extraterrestrial files will \u201csoon\u201d be declassified . The Secretary of War confirmed he is preparing to comply with the White House\u2019s historic declassification executive order, admitting he \u201cdid not have that on my bingo card at all,\u201d but says his Department \u201chave got our people working on it\u201d and \u201cwill be in full compliance.\u201d Rep. Luna says all UAP files will be housed on the National Archives website. Back on the ground, the intelligence explosion is generating its own paradoxes. Employers report AI-assisted job applications all sound the same now, deprioritizing the very candidates who optimized hardest. The frontier of statecraft is no less surreal: White House officials are exploring a stablecoin for Gaza , programming monetary policy for a war zone. Meanwhile, people are competing to infringe as many movie studio properties as possible in a single Seedance 2 crossover video, stress-testing IP law for sport. It turns out the Singularity is a character that learned to play itself. Thanks for reading The Innermost Loop! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work."
